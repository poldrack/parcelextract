# Development scratchpad

- Use this file to keep notes on ongoing development work.
- When the work is completed, clean it out from this file, so that the contents only reflect ongoing work.

## âœ… COMPLETED: Phase 2 - Output Writing Module

### Completed: `io/writers.py` - DONE

- Automatic directory structure creation for both TSV and JSON outputs
- Data transposition (parcels as columns, timepoints as rows)
- Integration with pathlib for robust file handling

**Status**: 4 new tests passing, 82 total tests passing, 90% coverage maintained, 100% coverage on writers.py
