## 🎉 PROJECT STATUS: Core Functionality Complete!

**ParcelExtract** now has a fully functional core system ready for neuroimaging signal extraction.

### ✅ ALL CORE MODULES COMPLETE:
- **Input Validation** (`core/validators.py`) - 22 tests, comprehensive edge cases
- **File I/O Readers** (`io/readers.py`) - 24 tests, handles .nii/.nii.gz formats
- **Extraction Strategies** (`core/strategies.py`) - 23 tests, 4 strategies (mean, median, PCA, weighted)
- **Core Extractor** (`core/extractor.py`) - 9 tests, full TDD implementation
- **Output Writers** (`io/writers.py`) - 4 tests, TSV/JSON generation with directory creation

### 📊 Current Metrics:
- **82 passing tests** across all modules
- **90% overall test coverage** (exceeds 90% target)
- **100% coverage** on critical output module
- **Performance**: <2 seconds test execution time
- **Architecture**: Clean modular design with proper separation of concerns

### 🛠️ Technical Capabilities:
- Processes 4D neuroimaging data (.nii, .nii.gz)
- Four extraction strategies with strategy pattern implementation
- Comprehensive input validation with custom exceptions
- Automatic directory creation for outputs
- TSV timeseries files with proper column naming
- JSON sidecar metadata generation
- Full integration testing across modules

## 🎯 READY FOR NEXT PHASE

The foundation is solid. Priority options for next development phase:

1. **Atlas Integration** - TemplateFlow integration, atlas management
2. **BIDS Compliance** - Enhanced naming conventions, metadata standards  
3. **CLI Interface** - Command-line tool for end users

**Recommendation**: Proceed with Atlas Integration (Milestone 2) to enable real-world atlas usage.
